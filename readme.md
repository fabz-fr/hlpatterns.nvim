require('hlpatterns').setup()

## Default configuration

The default configuration is defined below. The following content doesn't need to be copied in the setup function.

```
	min_color = min_color,
	max_color = max_color,
	highlight_priority = 100,
	fgcolor = "FFFFFF",
	min_red_color = min_color,
	max_red_color = max_color,
	min_green_color = min_color,
	max_green_color = max_color,
	min_blue_color = min_color,
	max_blue_color = max_color,

	group_name = "custom",

	highlight_pattern_keymap = nil
	delete_all_highlight_keymap = nil,
	highlight_selected_keymap = nil,
```

The default configuration doesn't create keymaps to highlight pattern, If you want, you can add it to the configuration by settings the following values: 
- `highlight_pattern_keymap`
- `highlight_pattern_keymap`
- `delete_all_highlight_keymap`

Usage

Several functions are available to the user :
